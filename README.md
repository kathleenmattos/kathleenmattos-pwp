## Milestone 1 Feedback
Your purpose, audience, and goal lack a bit of detail. The more detail you add here in this section will help you through the design process and relating UI/UX concepts for those who will be visiting this site. Persona is missing a user story but overall it has good content. Refer to the example with the link here.

## Milestone 2a Feedback
Good work on the wireframes and the content strategy. They are clear & to the point of how you want to create your PWP. This will make things easier going into development. Because of the simplicity of your site, I would suggest using a good color scheme and a good font style to balance out your content.

Additional recommendations/documentation for you:

For displaying your photos at full size when clicked, I would suggest checking out something like FancyBox3. I have provided a link to the JavaScript library that will help you create this animation.  https://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/

Google Fonts - has ~1000 free fonts & easy to integrate https://fonts.google.com/

FontAwesome - quality library with free iconography for use.

If you're feel taking a reading ahead regarding the contact form integration, here is the documentation:

We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no frontend-facing site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Remember use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory for now!
